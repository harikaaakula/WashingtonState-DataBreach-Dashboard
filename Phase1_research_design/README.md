# Phase 1 – Research Design and Problem Definition

##  Objective
This phase focuses on identifying current phenomena or events, selecting a dataset relating to the identified event and defining the **Research goals, Research questions, and Dataset scope**. It establishes the foundation for data analysis and dashboard creation in later phases.

---

## Key Components
- Defined **SMART goal** aligned with Doran’s (1981) management model.
- Selected Dataset: **“Data Breach Notifications Affecting Washington Residents (Personal Information Breakdown)”** 
- Designed **5 research questions** focusing on:
  1. Year-wise breach frequency and impacted individuals.
  2. Relationship between industry and breach cause.
  3. Personal data categories most compromised.
  4. Breach lifecycle and affected individuals.
  5. Cyberattack type trends across years.
- Identified variables, target audience, and suggested visuals.
- Outlined **potential use cases** for policymakers, CISOs, and risk managers.

## Research Questions identified
- How did the number of incidents and impacted Washingtonians affect the frequency and scale of data breaches from 2014 to 2026?
- What is the relationship between the industry impacted by a breach and its cause of breach? Which industries are the most susceptible to a particular kind of attack?
- Which categories of personal data are most compromised, and how can they be related to the industry-specific business type and the cause of the breach?
- Is there a relationship between the breach lifecycle, the number of affected individuals, or the type of data compromised? Are specific industries or breach causes associated with faster or slower response times?
- Which specific cyberattack is the most common cause of breach, and has the prevalence of these particular types changed over the years?

## Reflection
This phase set a clear direction for data analysis by connecting research phenomena with decision-making needs. The research framework and dataset context helped prepare for data wrangling and Power BI modelling in Phase 2.
