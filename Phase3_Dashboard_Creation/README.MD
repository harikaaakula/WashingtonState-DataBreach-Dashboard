## Phase 3: Final Dashboard Creation

In the final phase, the cleaned and aggregated dataset was used to design and build an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard focuses on the following guiding research questions:

1. How have the number of reported data breaches and the total impacted Washington residents changed over time (2016â€“2026)?
2. What is the relationship between the industry impacted by a breach and its cause of breach, identifying industries most susceptible to specific cyberattacks?

The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations to effectively communicate insights:

- **Line charts** to show trends in breaches and **Bar Chart** to display affected residents over time.
- **Stacked bar charts and heatmaps** to illustrate relationships between industries, breach causes, impacted individuals.
- **Summary metrics** for decision-making, highlighting key breach patterns and high-risk sectors.

Additional pages were created to enhance usability and context:

- **More Info page**: Provides dataset details, author information, and versioning.
- **Conclusion page**: Summarizes findings and explains how the dashboard guides decision-making for stakeholders.

This dashboard enables Policymakers, Cybersecurity Professionals, and Business Executives to derive actionable insights, improve resource allocation, and strengthen consumer protection strategies.
